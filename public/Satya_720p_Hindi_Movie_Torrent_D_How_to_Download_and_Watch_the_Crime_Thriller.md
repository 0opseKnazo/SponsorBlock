The film does not shy away from showing the brutal consequences of crime and the moral dilemmas of the characters.
 
The film also boasts of some memorable dialogues and scenes that have become iconic in Indian cinema. For example, the scene where Bhiku Mhatre (Manoj Bajpayee) introduces himself as "Mumbai ka King" (King of Mumbai) to Satya (J.D. Chakravarthy) is considered one of the best introductions of a character in Bollywood. Another scene that stands out is the climax, where Satya and Bhiku face their enemies in a shootout at a graveyard.
 
Satya also features a stellar soundtrack composed by Vishal Bhardwaj and Sandeep Chowta. The songs are catchy and suit the mood and theme of the film. Some of the popular songs from the film are "Sapne Mein Milti Hai", "Goli Maar" and "Badalon Se". The background score by Sandeep Chowta is also effective and enhances the impact of the film.
