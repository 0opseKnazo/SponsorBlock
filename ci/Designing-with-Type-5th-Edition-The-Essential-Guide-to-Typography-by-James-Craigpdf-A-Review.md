## Typefaces and Fonts
 
A typeface is a set of characters that share a common design and style. A font is a specific size and weight of a typeface. For example, Helvetica is a typeface, and Helvetica 12 pt bold is a font. There are thousands of typefaces and fonts available today, and choosing the right ones for your project can be challenging. Here are some factors to consider when selecting typefaces and fonts:
 
- Purpose: What is the goal and message of your project? Who is your audience? What tone and mood do you want to convey? Different typefaces and fonts can have different associations and impressions, such as formal or casual, elegant or playful, modern or classic, etc. Choose typefaces and fonts that match your purpose and audience.
- Legibility: How easy is it to recognize and distinguish the characters in a typeface or font? Legibility depends on factors such as size, weight, contrast, spacing, shape, proportion, etc. Choose typefaces and fonts that are clear and readable at the intended size and distance.
- Readability: How easy is it to read and comprehend a text in a typeface or font? Readability depends on factors such as alignment, line length, line spacing, paragraph spacing, indentation, punctuation, etc. Choose typefaces and fonts that are comfortable and pleasant to read.
- Compatibility: How well do different typefaces and fonts work together in a project? Compatibility depends on factors such as harmony, contrast, balance, hierarchy, etc. Choose typefaces and fonts that complement each other and create a coherent and consistent design.
